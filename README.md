# ASIC_Macro_RoomControl_Tool

Deployment desktop application for deploying Macros and In-Room control to Webex Room Kit devices.


## Business/Technical Challenge

As Webex Room Device are deployed leveraging Macros and In-Room controls allows customers to leverage more functionality by building custom interfaces and function on Room Kit devices. Today, cloud registered devices have no way of deploying Macros and In-Room control files en-mass. Every endpoint has to be accessed via a web admin interface to upload or update
macro or in-room control files. A slow and painful process for a video administrator when there are large numbers of endpoints. 

This is also a problems for administrator of on-premise deployment by requiring complex server infastructure and processes to deploy files.

## Proposed Solution

Utilizing open source technologies and the Webex Room Kit API's build a desktop application capable of delivering macro and in-room control files to endpoints easily. This would reduce the time to deploy and update endpoint files and give administrators more control of cloud and on-premise endpoint deployments.
